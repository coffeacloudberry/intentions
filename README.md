> "Plan your trip & tell someone, it could save your life."

It's a good practice to tell someone your intentions when you plan exploring wilderness, just in case you are stuck or lost. This web application is intended to ask yourself important questions and share enough information to your trusted contact. Basically, you fill in a form and a PDF is generated with your personal information along with tips and instructions. The PDF is created client-side to avoid transmitting sensitive data and because JavaScript is fun. I developed this project to improve my skills in JavaScript (ES2015) and discover React.

Features:

-   [x] Dynamic form for solo and team planning,
-   [x] Dynamic PDF generator,
-   [x] Multilingual: English and French,
-   [x] Privacy by design with zero knowledge.
